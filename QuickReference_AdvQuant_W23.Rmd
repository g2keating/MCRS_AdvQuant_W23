# Installing and loading packages
install.packages() buys the book from the bookstore. 
library() takes it off the shelf for you to use. 

```{r}
#install.packages(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Conditional statements
For when you are doing a TEST of if something is true or not:
>, < : greater than, less than 
<=, >= : greater than or equal to, less than or equal to
!= : does NOT equal
== : exactly equals
%in% : matches (out of more than one other value)

```{r}
testvector <- c(1,5,6,4,10)

4 %in% testvector
# should return TRUE

3 %in% testvector
# should return FALSE
```

# Data Cleaning and Diagnostic functions - 

## how big, long, wide, is my data? what are the dimensions? 
```{r}
nrow(iris)
ncol(iris)

dim(iris)
```

What are the columns in my dataset? what kind of information do they have? 
```{r}
str(iris)
glimpse(iris)
summary(iris)

names(iris)
colnames(iris)
```

How long is my vector?
```{r}
vector <- c(25, "wordle", "franklin", 25, 52, "wordle", 25)

length(vector)
```

What positions in my vector have the specified value, or meet a conditional statement? 
```{r}
which(vector == 25)
```

How many different unique values are there in my vector or dataset?
```{r}
unique(vector)
unique(iris$Species)
```

What data structure do I have?
```{r}
class(vector)
class(iris)
class(testmatrix)
typeof(vector)
```


# Data Cleaning functions

Changing your column format data type factor character numeric using mutate
```{r}
glimpse(iris) # default the data columns are double (aka numeric) and Species is a factor

# to make it a character:
iris %>% mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

# to make it a factor: 
glimpse(mpg) # manufacturer is a character, we want it as a factor
mpg %>% mutate(manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer))

# Integers vs. Double 
## both are numeric data types - only difference is how R stores them (integers are whole numbers and take up slightly less computer space)
glimpse(mpg) 
mpg %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) # notice how it shifts to double
```



# Basic R (not tidyverse) ways of doing a few things that are worth knowing

## IF statements and IF ELSE statements are ways of returning a value based on a conditional statement
```{r}
if (test_expression) {
statement
}

x <- 5
if(x > 0){
print("Positive number")
}
```

## FOR LOOPS allow you to do something many times, or iterate a function
```{r}
newvector <- c() # create an empty vector

for(i in 1:nrow(iris)){ # for each value (i) that occurs in the sequence 1 through nrow(iris)
  # do this thing with that value substituted in for i
  newvector[i] <- iris$Petal.Length[i] - iris$Petal.Width[i] 
  }

newvector
```


## Functions: to write or define your own function
```{r}
# define the function

myfancyfunction <- function(inputvariable){
  # stuff to do to the input variable or data
  inputvariable * 2
}

# Once defined, it runs like any other function
myfancyfunction(10)
```





# Data Structures (different shapes that your data can take)

What structure is my data in?
```{r}
class(vector)
class(iris)
class(testmatrix)
```


## Vectors: A vector is a one-dimensional object storing data
```{r}
# can contain numbers
vector <- c(1,2,3,4)

# or words, or both
vector <- c("Alladin", "Rajah", "Jasmine")

# make a vector that repeats NA 20 times
vector <- rep(NA, 20)
```

## Matrices: A matrix is a two dimensional object for storing data
```{r}
vector <- c(1:9)
testmatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Select values from a matrix (or dataframe) using the straight brackets
testmatrix[1,2] # value from row 1, column 2
```

## Dataframes and tibbles: A dataframe or a tibble is also two-dimensional, but it is tidy - it has the variable specifically on the columns and the observations on the rows. 
```{r}
# cars is a dataframe, testmatrix is not. See how R displays them differently. 
cars
testmatrix

# to force something to become a dataframe, use the data.frame() function
testdf <- data.frame(testmatrix)
testdf

# a tibble is similar to a dataframe, but works better with tidyverse. 
testtbl <- as_tibble(testmatrix)
testtbl

```


## Lists are objects that can store lots of other objects of the same or different type. 
```{r}
allirises <- list(iris, iris3)
allirises # now contains both

allirises[1] # shows the first data in the list

# fun fact: tibbles and dataframes are actually stored in the computer as lists... of columns
```

# Data types

Tell what format your data is stored in with typeof() or a lot at a time with glimpse()
```{r}
glimpse(iris)
typeof(cars$speed)

typeof(iris$Species)

typeof(vector)

# these can give confusing answers - Google it!
```


# Importing Data

## From a .csv file, from Excel or other spreadsheet software
```{r}
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
CDM2 <- read_csv("CDM_data.csv")
```

## From RData files
If someone has given you a .Rdata file, this is an R file type that contains multiple data objects so that you can easily import them and use them without having to rename all the objects. Check the 
"Environment" pane in the upper right - you'll see a whole bunch of new objects. Try viewing a few of them. 

```{r}
load("S4E2e.RData")
head(ps)
```
Check the 
"Environment" pane in the upper right - you'll see a whole bunch of new objects. Try viewing a few of them.

## From an Excel workbook (single sheet)
```{r}
raw_data <- read_excel("RawData.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Sheet 1", 
             # col_names = FALSE # which you choose depends on if you have only one row of column names in your excel document
             # col_names = TRUE
             )
```

## From Excel, multiple sheets, multiple libraries

### Find the path to a file
```{r}
file.choose()
# this will give you a pop-up window - choose the file you want the path to, and R will return the path in the Console.
```

```{r}
# library(fs)

# define the path (using the path from the last chunk)
path_to_file <- "/Users/amyhenry/Desktop/The Bowl Project Analysis/BowlSpecies_forEdits.xlsx"

mad <- path_to_file %>%
        excel_sheets() %>%
        set_names() %>%
       map(read_excel,
           path = path_to_file)
        
str(mad)
```

## Import Multiple Sheets from Multiple Excel files using a defined function and map() to apply to multiple files
```{r}
path_to_file <- "/Users/amyhenry/Desktop/The Bowl Project Analysis/BowlSpecies_forEdits.xlsx"

# define the new function to take the path and apply read_excel to the file at the end of the path
read_multiple_excel <- function(path) {
  path %>%
    excel_sheets() %>% 
    set_names() %>% 
  map(read_excel, path = path, col_names = FALSE)
}

# use the map() function to apply the read_multiple_excel function to all the files in the directory/folder that have "xlsx" in their name
data <- dir_ls(path = path_raw, regexp = "xlsx") %>% 
           map(read_multiple_excel)

# results in a list
data
```


### Change object format
From matrix to data frame
```{r}
iris_dataframe <- as.data.frame(iris)
iris_dataframe
```

from matrix to tibble
```{r}
iris_tibble <- as_tibble(iris)
iris_tibble
```



# Viewing data

## Print shows the data in the console
```{r}
iris
print(iris)
```

## Kable, from the knitr package makes nice looking tables that take up less space in your markdown and are easier to view. 
```{r}
#install.packages("knitr")
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```

## View() opens up a tab in RStudio to view your data in a spreadsheet. Will prevent RMarkdown from knitting. 
* from tidyverse
```{r}
View(iris)
```

## glimpse() tells you the data format for each column, the first few entries, and the number of rows and columns
* from tidyverse
```{r}
glimpse(iris)
```

# Manipulating and combining multiple tables

## bind_rows() and bind_cols() staple dataframes together that have matching dimensions
bind_rows() will put two dataframes on top of each other if they have the same column names (they don't need to have them in the same order) 
```{r}
nrow(iris)
doubleiris <- bind_rows(iris,iris)
nrow(doubleiris)
```

bind_cols() adds columns to a dataframe if there are the same number of rows, without matching. this only works if your data is in the same order!

```{r}
iris1 <- iris %>% select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
iris1
iris2 <- iris %>% select(Petal.Length, Petal.Width)
iris2

bind_cols(iris2, iris1)
```

## Join functions combine dataframes that have different numbers of rows and columns, but at least one shared column to match the observations by, side-by-side. Observations don't have to be in order. There are several kinds of join functions, well-explained simply at this website:
https://statisticsglobe.com/r-dplyr-join-inner-left-right-full-semi-anti


```{r}
band_members
band_instruments
```


```{r}
#full_join keeps all rows from both dataframes, and fills in NA if there is no match. 
full_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```


```{r}
#left_join() only keeps all the rows in the first dataframe, and discards ones without matches from the second.
left_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```


```{r}
#  right_join() does the opposite. 
right_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```


```{r}
# inner_join() only keeps rows that have matches in both dataframes. 
inner_join(band_members, band_instruments)

```

# Summarizing, Counting, and Uncounting

## count() 
gets you the number of rows in an object. group_by() makes it count separately for different levels of a factor, or different combinations of two factors. 
```{r}
mpg %>% count()

mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>% count()

mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer, model) %>% count()
```

## uncount() 
If you have a dataframe where one row already contains count data, and you would like to expand it so that one row is each observation (i.e., if the count value is 4, to duplicate that row 4 times). In this example of survey data, the data was already summarized, but we'd rather have one row per response. 
```{r}
freq_table <- tribble(
  ~response,           ~n,
  "too strict",        99,
  "not strict enough", 507,
  "just about right",  151,
  "not sure",          42
)

nrow(freq_table)
sum(freq_table$n)
# number of responses

freq_table %>% uncount(n, .id = "ResponseID")

freq_table %>% uncount(n, .id = "ResponseID") %>% nrow()
# same as number of responses - number of rows.
```


## summarize() or summarise() 
will compute summary statistics (or other) over values in one or more columns. 
mean, median, max, min, sd, and n() [count] will all work. 

works with group_by(). 
```{r}
mpg %>% summarize(MeanCityMPG = mean(cty), MeanHwyMPG = mean(hwy))

mpg %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarize(MeanCityMPG = mean(cty), MeanHwyMPG = mean(hwy), n = n())

mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer, model) %>% summarize(MeanCityMPG = mean(cty), MeanHwyMPG = mean(hwy), n = n())

```


# Saving the outputs of your data analysis

## saving or exporting your data to CSV
Let's say you've successfully cleaned your data and you want to save it in its clean form so that you or your teammates or future collaborators can use it. This is very easy and very similar to the functions you used to import your data! 
```{r}
write_csv(iris, "iris.csv")

```

## saving to a .Rdata file

This is great if you have multiple objects to keep together and know that a future user will be using R to look at it. 
```{r}
save(iris, cars, file = "AFewThings.Rdata")
```

## Save or write a picture, graph, plot, image to file PDF TIFF or JPG

```{r}

# Open the file
pdf("rplot.pdf") # need to create a new file name here, including suffix
# Create a plot
ggplot()+geom_whatever()
# Close the pdf file (look in the Files tab/Project folder)
dev.off() 

# also works for JPG - can define the image size
jpeg("rplot.jpg", width = 350, height = "350") # Open the file
ggplot()+geom_whatever()
dev.off()

# also works for JPG - can define the image size
tiff("rplot.tiff", width = 4, height = 3, units = "in", res = 300) # sets the size and resolution to 300 dpi (very crisp)
ggplot()+geom_whatever()
dev.off()
```


## Export table: Nicely formatting and exporting a table from R

```{r}
# Create a summary table
iris_summary <- iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n(), 
    MeanSL = mean(Sepal.Length), 
    SD_SL = sd(Sepal.Length), 
    MeanSW = mean(Sepal.Width), 
    SD_SW = sd(Sepal.Width))

# format the numbers so that they're in appropriate significant figures
iris_rounded <- iris_summary %>% mutate_at(c("MeanSL", "SD_SL", "MeanSW", "SD_SW"), ~round(.,digits = 2))
```

### paste or combine or merge or fuse or merge the Mean and SD columns for each variable to get a pretty looking Mean +/- SD column
```{r}
# combine with parentheses around the standard deviation using the paste function
iris_rounded %>% 
  mutate(`Mean Sepal Length (SD)` = paste(MeanSL, " (", SD_SL,")", sep = ""))

# OR

# pasted with the +/- symbol
iris_rounded %>% 
  mutate(`Sepal Length (M ± SD)` = paste(MeanSL, label="±", SD_SL)) 
# the +/- symbol was pasted in from elsewhere, I don't know how to directly type it in

# OR

# use UNITE to merge the columns without paste and specify the delimiter
# general format: 
  # unite("New Column Name", c(Columns to Unite), sep = "what you want between them")

iris_rounded %>%
  unite(`Sepal Length (M ± SD)`, MeanSL:SD_SL, sep = "±")

```

#### Complete example of a nice table:
```{r}
iris_table <- iris_rounded %>% 
  mutate(`Sepal Length (M ± SD)` = paste(MeanSL, label="±", SD_SL), 
         `Sepal Width (M ± SD)` = paste(MeanSW, label="±", SD_SW)) %>%
  select(Species, n, `Sepal Length (M ± SD)`, `Sepal Width (M ± SD)`)
```

#### View that table nicely with kable(), exports pretty when knitted
```{r}
iris_table %>% knitr::kable()
```


### Export tables to Word:

- Create a table or data.frame in R.
- Write this table to a comma-separated .txt file using write.table().
- Copy and paste the content of the .txt file into Word.
- In Word, select the text you just pasted from the .txt file
- go to Table → Convert → Convert Text to Table…
- make sure “Commas” is selected under “Separate text at”, click OK
```{r}
# Export table
write.table(iris_summary, file = "iristable.txt", sep = ",", row.names = F)
```


# Data Manipulation

## Change the name of a column with the rename() function
```{r}
colnames(iris)
# format
dataframe %>% rename(NewName = OldName)
iris %>% rename(SL = Sepal.Length, PL = Petal.Length)

```

## The mutate() function makes new columns or transforms existing columns
```{r}
# To make a new column
#format
dataframe %>% mutate(NewColumn = )

# make a column with unique values for each row or the same numbers for each row
iris %>% mutate(RowNumbers = 1:nrow(iris))

iris %>% mutate(Constant = 27)

iris %>% mutate()

# Make a new column with a calculation from some other column(s)
iris %>% mutate(Sepal.Ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)

# Make a new column that depends on the numeric values of a different column with case_when()
iris %>% mutate(BigFlower = 
                  case_when(
                    # [For lines when this condition is true] ~ Have this value,
                    Petal.Length > 1.4 ~ "Big",
                    Petal.Length == 1.4 ~ "Not Big", # double equals means a test
                    TRUE ~ as.character(Petal.Length) # This line is a "catchall" for any lines that don't fit a condition. if you don't use this line, those cells will default to NA. It basically says, just put Petal.Length there if you haven't got anything else. 
                  )
                )
```


## SELECT: Choose Use or Select only certain specific COLUMNS using select()
```{r}
glimpse(iris)

# choose using column names
iris %>% select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Species)

# or column numbers
iris %>% select(1:3, 5)

# or both
iris %>% select(1:2, Species)
```

## FILTER: Choose select subset for only certain specific ROWS that meet a condition using FILTER()
```{r}
# filter for just oneo 
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa")

# rows can be either setosa OR versicolor
# filter so that we keep BOTH setosa AND versicolor
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa" | Species == "versicolor") \

# WRONG - no rows can be equal to setosa AND versicolor at the same time, so this returns zero rows. 
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa" & Species == "versicolor") 

# rows must be both setosa AND greater than 1.3
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa" & Petal.Length > 1.3)
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa", Petal.Length > 1.3) # works the same as above

```

# Reshape or transform the dataframe so it has different dimensions
### Move rows to columns or transform the dataset to make it wider or longer using  pivot_longer() and pivot_wider()

```{r}
pivot_longer(mydata, 
  cols, # columns that should pivot from wide to long (unquoted)
  names_to, # name of the new category column as a quoted string
  values_to # name of the new value column as a quoted string
)

iris %>% select(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Species) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Petal.Length, Petal.Width), 
               names_to = "Measurement", 
               values_to = "cm")
```

# pivot_wider() reshapes the data to have more columns
```{r}
pivot_wider(mydata, 
  id_cols, # optional vector of columns you do not want affected
  names_from, # category column(s) to pivot from long to wide
  values_from # value columns(s) that hold data for each category column
  names_sep # optional string separator for category-value columns
)

rent_income_wide <- pivot_wider(us_rent_income,
             # id_cols = optional vector of unaffected columns,
             names_from = c(variable),
             values_from = c(estimate, moe),
             names_sep = "_"         
)
```

# COUNT and SUMMARISE or SUMMARIZE collapse many rows into few rows with the help of GROUP_BY()
```{r}
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% # calculate it separately for each species
  summarize(MeanPetalLength = mean(Petal.Length),
            MeanPetalWidth = mean(Petal.Width))

```


# MAP allows you to do the same function (iterate) to multiple dataframes at the same time
```{r}
typeof(iris3)

iris3$versicolor
someirises <-  list(iris[1:4], iris[1:4], iris[1:4])

map(someirises, colSums)
```


# Plotting with GGplot

There are three really basic components you need for any ggplot - the dataset, the variables you want on each axis, and a geom to tell it what kind of plot to make. Examples of geoms: geom_bar(), geom_histogram(), geom_boxplot(), geom_line() - all pretty intuitive about what they'll make! These pieces are layered into the plot with + signs. 

What it looks like when you put those things together
ggplot(<dataset>) + 
  aes(x = <variable you want on the x-axis from dataset>, y = <ditto for y>) + 
  geom_<typeofplot>(<modifiers of that plot>)
  
  
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
```
  
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +  # this line makes the space to put the plot, the background
  aes(x = chocolate) + # this says what to put on the axes
  geom_bar() # this says what kind of plot to make, in this case, a barplot that automatically did counts of the observations of which candies were chocolate or not chocolate. 
```

ggplots can be defined as an object and recalled later too. This is useful when you are adding more geoms and trying things out, or when you're compiling the plots into a multiple plot figure or exporting them. 

```{r}
chocolate_bar <- ggplot(candy_rankings) +  
  aes(x = chocolate) + 
  geom_bar() 

chocolate_bar
```

## Geom vs. Stat
Some plots can use stat_ instead of geom_ for the visualization. You can think of geoms as geometric objects, which you'll use most often, while stat_ is for statistical transformations. For example, here we've plotted the win percentage (how often people ranked it in their favorites) against sugar percent, to ask the question, do sweeter candies win more often?

We're using the geom_point() function to plot this as a scatter plot. 

```{r}
sweetness <- ggplot(candy_rankings) + 
  aes(x = sugarpercent, y = winpercent) + 
  geom_point()
```

To add a best-fit regression line, we can use the stat_smooth() function. 

```{r}
#notice how you can add the layer to the already created object
sweetness + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
sweetness <- ggplot(candy_rankings) + 
  aes(x = chocolate, y = sugarpercent) + 
  stat_boxplot()
sweetness
```

## Reference for which geoms/stats to use for which kinds of plots: 
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

Also, see the ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf file in this folder. 

## Try making a histogram! Play around with some of the variables and plot types from these references. 

## Modifying colors
Reference: 
bit.ly/colors-r

You can change the color as a SET AESTHETIC in the geom argument. Test out how it works on differenc geoms!
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +  
  aes(x = chocolate) + 
  geom_bar(color = 'darkblue', fill = 'coral') 
```


If you want the color to reflect another variable, as a MAPPED AESTHETIC (because you've mapped color to that variable) for example, if there is fruit in the candy too, then you can assign that under aes(). 
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +  
  aes(x = chocolate, fill = fruity) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

you can assign specific colors to your fills or other aesthetics using scale_xxx_manual or 
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +  
  aes(x = chocolate, fill = fruity) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 1) +
  geom_bar() 

ggplot(candy_rankings) +  
  aes(x = chocolate, fill = fruity) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("magenta", "limegreen")) +
  geom_bar() 
```


## Shapes
Working on a scatterplot and want the points to be different shapes? Assign them as a SET AESTHETIC

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = pricepercent,
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point(shape = 2)
```

Similarly, you can map shape to another variable as a MAPPED AESTHETIC
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = pricepercent,
      y = winpercent, 
      shape = chocolate) +
  geom_point()
```

## Labels

Change your plot title, subtitle, caption, x or y axis labels or names
Pretty self-explanatory here. labs() are added separately from the other plot parameters.
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = sugarpercent, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Sugar Percentage",
       y = "Win Percentage",
       title = "Relationship between the dependent and independent variable",
       subtitle = "for Halloween candies",
       caption = "Based on an online Survey by FiveThirtyEight")

```


## X and Y axis limits

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = sugarpercent, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 100)
```

## Examples of other types of plots

### Barplot

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = chocolate) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) + 
  aes(x = winpercent) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Density Plot

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) + 
  aes(x = winpercent) +
  geom_density()
```


### Dot plot
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) + 
  aes(x = winpercent) +
  geom_dotplot()
```
Note the error message - try adding the argument "binwidth = 3" to the geom_dotplot() line. 

### Boxplot 

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = chocolate, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Scatter pLot

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = pricepercent, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point()
```

### Examples of multiple layered plots

```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = pricepercent, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

With a line fitted using the lm() function instead of a smoothed line. Test out what happens when you set "se = TRUE". 
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = pricepercent, 
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE)
```

Multiple plots in multiple panes - 
what happens when you move the . and ~ next to chocolate, like in the commented out line? 
```{r}
ggplot(candy_rankings) +
  aes(x = sugarpercent,
      y = winpercent) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~chocolate)
  #facet_grid(chocolate~.)
```




# General Linear Models 

## Assumption Checks

### Normality
```{r}
# Visually

somedata <- cbind(seq(1:50), rnorm(50, mean = 15, sd = 5)) %>% as_tibble()
glimpse(somedata)

hist(somedata$V2, breaks = 5) # breaks codes for the number of bins
plot(density(somedata$V2))

ggplot(somedata, aes(x = V2)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) # binwidth is the size of bins

# Statistically with the Shapiro-Wilk test 
shapiro.test(somedata$V2)
```

##### With a Q-Q plot
```{r}
qqnorm(somedata$V2)
qqline(my_data$len, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

# OR

#library("car")
car::qqPlot(somedata$V2)

# does your data fit in the blue zone (standard error)? Then you're good. 
```

### Homoscedasticity/Heteroscedasticity/ Homogeneity of Variance

```{r}
# Visually, for a regression model
carmodel <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
plot(dist~ speed, cars)
plot(carmodel, which = c(1))

# Visualy, for an ANOVA  model
irismodel <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
plot(irismodel, which = c(1))
# Does it look like the points are evenly distributed above and below on both ends? Not too many outliers (labeled with numbers)?
```

For ANOVAs
```{r}
# Bartlett's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (only good with normal data) 
bartlett.test(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (okay with marginally-normal data)
# library(car)
car::leveneTest(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# Fligner-Killeen test: a non-parametric test which is very robust against departures from normality.
fligner.test(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
```

### Transformations

#### FOR RIGHT SKEWED DATA
Logarithmic (log) transformation - right skewed data
Does not work with zero - can add 1 or another small value to make it fit. 
```{r}
x <- rbeta(10000,2,5) # right skewed data
plot(hist(x))

log() 
log(x + 1)


hist(log(x))
# is actually the natural log, not base 10
```

The square root transformation (right-skewed distributions)
```{r}
sqrt()

hist(sqrt(x))
```

The Reciprocal transformation (right-skewed data)
```{r}
1/x

hist(1/x)
```
#### FOR LEFT-SKEWED DATA
# Reflect data by subtracting from the maximum data point
```{r}
x <- rbeta(10000,5,2) # left skewed data
hist(x)

hist(max(x)-x)
```

Square transformation (left s)
```{r}
x^2

hist(x^2)
```
Exponential Transformation
```{r}
exp(x)

hist(exp(x))
```


### Arcsine transformation
```{r}
# The arcsine transformation (controversially used for proportion data)

z <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 0.3, sd = 0.25) 
z <- z[z>0 & z<1]
hist(z)
asin(sqrt(x))

hist(asin(sqrt(z)))

```

## Linear Regression
```{r}
# modeling

model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)
summary(model)

# coefficients
model$coefficients

# graphing
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

# OR Input your own formula for a different kind of fit
# y = exp(x) for exponential
# y = log(x) for logistic
# y ~ x + I(x^2) for polynomial or squared etc. 

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = (y ~ x + I(x^2)), se = FALSE)

cor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, iris)
```
### Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
carmodel <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(carmodel)

# no graphing
```

## T-tests
```{r}
# one sample  t-test
somedata <- rnorm(23, mean = 10, sd = 3)

t.test(somedata, mu = 15) # mu is the expected mean

# unpaired, two sample t-test
twochicks <- ChickWeight %>% filter(Time == 21, Diet == 2 | Diet == 1)
twochicks

t.test(weight ~ Diet, twochicks)

# Paired 
twotimetree <- Loblolly %>% filter(age == 20 | age == 25)
twotimetree

t.test(height ~ age, data = twotimetree, paired = TRUE)
```

## ANOVA

### One Way Anova (Completely Randomized Design)
 (there's no dataset here, just a reminder of how to format it)
```{r}
fit <- aov(y ~ A, data=mydataframe)


irismodel <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
anova(irismodel)

irismodel <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

### One-way ANOVA Post-Hoc test
```{r}
# Post-hoc test
TukeyHSD(irismodel)

## Plotting comparisons using the ggsignif package
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsignif/vignettes/intro.html
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot() + # using `ggsignif` to display comparison of interest
  geom_signif(
    comparisons = list(c("versicolor", "virginica")),
    map_signif_level = TRUE
  )
```

## Two Way ANOVA - Factorial Design 

The two-way factorial design has TWO categorical predictor variables and ONE response, and you are interested in interactions between the two predictor variables. 

Example: How do temperature (hi, med, lo)  and acidity (more acidic, more basic) affect algal photosynthesis rates?
```{r}
fit <- aov(y ~ A + B + A:B, data=mydataframe)
fit <- aov(y ~ A*B, data=mydataframe) # same thing
```

Two-way ANOVA example
```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl) + as.factor(gear), data = mtcars)
anova(model)

# OR, the following code gives EXACTLY the same thing. 

model <- aov(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl) + as.factor(gear), data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
carplot <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = mpg, fill = as.factor(gear)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
carplot
```


## ANCOVA
Analysis of Covariance 
ANCOVA uses general linear models to adjust treatment effects to account for a known confounding variable. 
- Confounding variables bias estimates of treatment effects. 
This is useful when you can't design an experiment that eliminates all confounding variables. 

Includes one categorical variable (A), which is the treatment we're interested in, and one continuous variable (x), which is the confounding variable.

Basic formula:
```{r}
fit <- aov(y ~ A + x, data=mydataframe)
```

Involves two rounds of model fitting: 
STEP 1) Test for the interaction between the treatment and covariate
```{r}
attach(mtcars)
```

Horsepower has an effect on MPG, but transmission type (automatic or manual, coded as "am") may confound it. 
```{r}
fit <- aov(mpg ~ hp*am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```
Is the interaction significant? No. 

STEP 1a) If no interaction is detected, then interaction term is dropped from model in second round. *** in our example the interaction isn't significant. Therefore we drop the interaction: 
```{r}
result <- aov(mpg ~ hp + am,data = mtcars)
```

STEP 2) compare the two models (with and without the interaction).

```{r}
result1 <- aov(mpg~hp*am,data = mtcars) # with interaction
result2 <- aov(mpg~hp+am,data = mtcars) # without interaction

print(anova(result1,result2))
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05 we conclude that the interaction between horse power and transmission type is not significant. So the mileage per gallon will depend in a similar manner on the horsepower of the car in both auto and manual transmission mode.
