#Garrett's new code 2.0 with Priscilla's notes from class - Create an INTERMEDIATE file that will be the MOST UPDATED working file
```{r}
#join() function will match columns across dataframes - options: full, left, right; essentially this would move us in the same direction as what Excel's vlookup function does

#For DN, use full join between DNCodes.csv and Spring_data_raw because both datafiles contain the same unique "Code" values. Ex. Spring_data_raw has "ARTICAL" and so will DNCodes.csv, along with another column (SpeciesCode) where "ARTICAL" is corrected to ARTCAL. This is because DNCodes was created from Spring_data_raw. This will address the issue of accounting for typos in the Spring_data_raw "Code" column and replacing with the corrected version found in the DNCodes.csv "SpeciesCode" column

#In order to pull information about whether the lifeform (grass, shrub, forb, etc.), status (native, non-native), this is where we would have to join the Species Key to the Spring_Data_raw by, once again, matching values based on how the SpeciesCode column is populated. We do this using a left join between Species Key and Spring_data_raw. We do not use a full join here because that would entail including all the extraneous species present in Species Key, but not actually encountered in real life/in the Spring_data_raw file. To decide whether you want to conduct a left or right join depends on which side of the argument (data) that you want to keep. A left join keeps the data on the left side of the argument that gets piped in, but not the data added afterwards on the right

Intermediate %>% filter(is.na(Transect) == TRUE)

#After looking back at the raw data for this instance, we determine that the NA is a result of the observer not recording the transect value. We can easily see that it is supposed to match the value of data row above it
#fill() will take the value from the data row above to populate the missing NA cell
Intermediate %>% fill(Transect)

#Data Sleuthing - Hits
```{R}
